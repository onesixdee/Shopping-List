Thinkful Unit 2 Lesson 3 | A shopping list built from scratch using jQuery. 

Build a Shopping List App

In this lesson, you'll design and code a project from scratch: a shopping list app. The basic requirements for this app are:

    Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase.
    Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list 
    Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.

It will be up to you to come up with the look and feel of your app.
